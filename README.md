kuali-hello-world-blog
======================

This sample hello world blog post application is meant to be a kitchen sink style eDoc form. It lists all the possible
types of form inputs and elements supported by eDocLite. It also uses bootstrap to style the eDocLite form instead of 
table based as the examples. This eDoc doesn't really use KEW. That will come in future commits as we learn more about
KEW.
